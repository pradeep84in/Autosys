#### AutoSys Workload Automation
Organizations need to effectively manage large volumes of complex, business-critical workloads across multiple applications and platforms. In such complex environments, there are number of business challenges you have to address:

Availability of critical business services. A single workload failure can have a significant impact on an organization’s capability to deliver services.
Respond to real time business events. Today’s on-demand business world requires real-time automation to efficiently respond to business events.
Improve IT efficiency. Reducing IT costs continues to be a key requirement for organizations, at the same time IT is expected to improve service delivery.
AutoSys Workload Automation enhances visibility and control of complex workloads across platforms, ERP systems, and the cloud. It helps to reduce the cost and complexity of managing mission critical business processes, ensuring consistent and reliable service delivery.
